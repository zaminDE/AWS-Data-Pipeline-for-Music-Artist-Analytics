# 🎵 AWS Music Data Pipeline

```plaintext
# Project: Serverless AWS Data Engineering Pipeline for music industry analytics
# Description: Ingests raw API data into S3, processes with AWS Glue, queries via Athena

📌 Problem Statement
# Stakeholders: Music industry (record labels, marketing teams, content creators)
# Needs:
#   - Identify most popular artists
#   - Analyze demand for artist types (solo, group, band)
#   - Track popularity trends over time
# Challenge: Raw CSV/JSON from music websites requires ETL for analytics

✅ Solution Overview
# Pipeline features:
#   - Automated ingestion with Lambda
#   - Raw data storage in S3 (Staging Layer)
#   - Schema discovery via AWS Glue Crawlers
#   - Data cleaning/transformation with AWS Glue ETL (PySpark)
#   - Curated data storage in S3 (Data Warehouse Layer)
#   - SQL querying with Amazon Athena

🏗️ Architecture Flow
API (Music Data Source)        # Provides raw JSON/CSV data
  ↓
Amazon EventBridge            # Triggers Lambda on schedule
  ↓
AWS Lambda                    # Fetches and uploads data to S3 staging
  ↓
Amazon S3 (Staging Layer)     # Stores raw data
  ↓
AWS Glue Crawler (Staging)    # Detects schema, updates Glue Catalog
  ↓
AWS Glue ETL Job (PySpark)    # Cleans, deduplicates, converts to Parquet
  ↓
Amazon S3 (Data Warehouse)    # Stores curated data
  ↓
AWS Glue Crawler (Curated)    # Updates schema for curated data
  ↓
Amazon Athena                 # SQL queries for analysis

⚡ Lambda Function
# Function: Ingests data, saves to S3 (staging)
# Extensible for APIs (e.g., Spotify)

# Example Code Snippet
import json
import boto3

s3 = boto3.client('s3')

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    data = {...}  # Sample or API-fetched data
    s3.put_object(
        Bucket="your-bucket-name",
        Key="staging/music_data.json",
        Body=json.dumps(data)
    )

🚀 Deployment Steps
# Steps:
1. Create S3 bucket:
   - Folders: staging/, data-warehouse/
2. Create Lambda function:
   - Upload: lambda_function.py
3. Assign IAM Role:
   - Policy: AmazonS3FullAccess
4. Configure EventBridge Rule:
   - Trigger: Lambda on schedule
5. Run Glue Crawler:
   - Target: staging/
   - Action: Detect schema
6. Create Glue ETL Job:
   - Action: Transform data to data-warehouse/
7. Run Glue Crawler:
   - Target: data-warehouse/
   - Action: Update schema
8. Query data:
   - Tool: Amazon Athena
