AWS Music Data Pipeline
Serverless AWS pipeline for music industry analytics. Ingests raw API data into S3, processes with Glue, queries via Athena.
Problem Statement
Stakeholders: Record labels, marketing teams, content creatorsNeeds:

Identify top artists
Analyze artist types (solo, group, band)
Track popularity trendsChallenge: Raw CSV/JSON data needs ETL for analytics

Solution Overview
Features:

Lambda for automated ingestion
S3 for raw (staging) and curated (data warehouse) storage
Glue Crawlers for schema discovery
Glue ETL (PySpark) for data cleaning/transformation
Athena for SQL queries

Architecture Flow
API (Music Data Source) -> Raw JSON/CSV data  ↓Amazon EventBridge -> Triggers Lambda on schedule  ↓AWS Lambda -> Fetches and uploads data to S3 staging  ↓Amazon S3 (Staging) -> Stores raw data  ↓AWS Glue Crawler (Staging) -> Detects schema, updates Glue Catalog  ↓AWS Glue ETL Job (PySpark) -> Cleans, deduplicates, converts to Parquet  ↓Amazon S3 (Data Warehouse) -> Stores curated data  ↓AWS Glue Crawler (Curated) -> Updates schema  ↓Amazon Athena -> SQL queries for analysis

Lambda Function
Role: Ingests data, saves to S3 (staging)Extensible: Supports APIs (e.g., Spotify)
# Code Snippet:
import json
import boto3
s3 = boto3.client('s3')
def lambda_handler(event, context):
    data = {...}  # Sample or API-fetched data
    s3.put_object(
        Bucket="your-bucket-name",
        Key="staging/music_data.json",
        Body=json.dumps(data)
    )

Deployment Steps

Create S3 bucket with folders: staging/, data-warehouse/
Create Lambda function, upload lambda_function.py
Assign IAM Role with AmazonS3FullAccess
Set EventBridge Rule to trigger Lambda on schedule
Run Glue Crawler on staging/ to detect schema
Create Glue ETL Job to transform data to data-warehouse/
Run Glue Crawler on data-warehouse/ to update schema
Query data using Athena
